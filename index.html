            <p>
            A passion and love for gaming that I cannot explain. World of Warcraft is my game of choice and something that I have played for over 10 years, even when I've decided to take a break I always seem to find myself coming back. Healing is my main
            role by choice but I pride myself on being able to play anything with a little practice. I've raided more castles and dungeon than I care to admit but I've made life long friends along the way, I wouldnt have it any other way.
